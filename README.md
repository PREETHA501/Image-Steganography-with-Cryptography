# InformationSystemSecurity
To enhance security, we combined both techniques: Cryptography and Steganography. 
A cryptographic algorithm, RSA is used to encrypt the secret message into ciphertext and vice versa. 
A steganographic algorithm, the Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique is used to embed the message into the image.
