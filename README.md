# Image Steganography with Cryptography

Image Steganography :
Steganography is the technique of hiding secret data within an ordinary, non-secret, file or message in order to avoid detection; the secret data is then extracted at its destination. In image steganography, a message is embedded into an image by altering the values of some pixels, which are chosen by an encryption algorithm.

Cryptography :
Cryptography is the science of protecting information by transforming it into a secure format. A cryptographic algorithm, or cipher, is a mathematical function used in the encryption and decryption process. A cryptographic algorithm works in combination with a key — a word, number, or phrase — to encrypt the plaintext. The same plaintext encrypts to different ciphertext with different keys.

To enhance security, We combined both Techniques: Cryptography and Steganography. 
A cryptographic algorithm, RSA is used to encrypt the secret message into ciphertext and vice versa. 
A steganographic algorithm, the Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique is used to embed the message into the image.
